# About

This is an interactive gallery of split (and other) keyboards, based on an [earlier version by Aposymbiont](https://github.com/Aposymbiont/split-keyboards/).

## Changes from the earlier version

- ported to [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/)
- image resizing and SASS compilation on build using HUGO
- table view in addition to the gallery view
- easy to develop frontend thanks to [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/)
- lightbox / image zooming 
- min/max key counts used for filtering
- all keyboard layouts combined to a single file
