# Split Keyboards

This is an interactive gallery of split keyboards, based on an [earlier list by diimdeep](https://github.com/diimdeep/awesome-split-keyboards).

The keyboards included are mechanical and have either two halves ar a "wedge" in the middle to allow the wrists to lie in a more natural position.  Many are available for purchase, either assembled or in kit form.  Some only have the source (plans) available, which means making (or ordering from a service) the circuit board and case from a manufacturer yourself.

A good resource for mass produced, membrane (non-mechanical) keyboards is [Xah-Lee's Ergonomic Keyboard Reviews](http://xahlee.info/kbd/ergonomic_keyboards_index.html).

The mechanical keyboards shown on this site are further classified as follows:

### Layout
Traditional
: traditional ergonomic keyboard; the normal layout with a wedge in the middle.

Ortholinear
: keys placed in a grid or near-grid.

Ergonomic
: keys usually staggered by column rather than row, and almost always including thumb keys.

Dished
: a shaped keyboard with thumbkeys and dishes or wells for the fingers.

### Number of keys
The minimum and maximum number of keys supported by the keyboard.  Some keyboards can be assembled with a different number of keys (for example, using a double-height key instead of two single-height keys).  Other keyboards are available with several variations on the design.  In either case, the filter is based on the maximum.

### Features

Two halves
: two independent parts to the keyboard

Rotary encoder
: one or more knobs which can press keys, useful for volume up/down, page-up/page-down, etc.

Trackball/point/trackpad
: an integrated trackball, laptop-syle trackpoint, or trackpad mouse.

Display
: a display on the keyboard, which can show status (Caps Lock, current layer, macros etc)

Wireless
: no wires!

### Availability
Mass produced
: Reliably in-stock for immediate delivery.
: Probably includes a GUI or other professional tool for configuring keyboard layout, macros etc.

Assembled
: Available for purchase pre-assembled and programmed.
: To distinguish this from the following categories, it omits keyboards where individuals are willing to assemble a kit for others — otherwise there's little point to the filter.  A company should be willing to buy an "assembled" keyboard for an employee, but less likely to ask someone on Reddit to solder a kit (below) for them.

Kit
: Kit (circuit boards, cases, components etc) available to purchase.
: Some people will assemble a kit for you, for a fee.

Plans (source)
: Open source keyboards, where files defining the PCB and case are available.  Sometimes, a group of people will order circuit boards and/or cases together to save costs, this is a *group buy*.

Unavailable
: The keyboard is no longer available, and was not open source
